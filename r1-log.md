# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jdeehh

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 6th April 2022
## Log

### R1D1 
Started a Metric/Imperial conversion app. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with whether to code in Javascript or ReactJS for quicker conversion of input information.

### R1D2
Day 2 #100DaysOfCode finished off the Unit converter app today, although I still need to do some refactoring to make it drier.

### R1D3
Day 3 - Set up layout for Password Generator app and have added respository here - will add JS tomorrow

### R1D4
Day 4 - Finished adding functionality to the Password Generator app with JS and have updated respository

### R1D5
Day 5 - Didn't start any new projects but managed to get some quick refactoring of the Password Generator in.
✅ Fixed bug causing values to add 1.
✅ Switch to line break over display:flex in h1
✅ Had a look at input spinners

### R1D6
Day 6 - Plotted out the layout for the Invoice Creator and considered customising the following functionalities:
- Custom line items
- Prompt for input of receivers email address

### R1D7
Day 7 - Finished adding inital functionality of invoice creator as per Scrimba's specs, although just need to add functionality to the Remove button and center the element.

### R1D8
Day 8 - Pushed myself to get some coding in after a 19 hour day. I worked on adding some more functionality to the invoice creator. But I think I need to sleep and look at this again with fresh eyes in the morning.

### R1D9
Day 9 - Invoice creator works...barely. I need to revisit this one at a later point to fix the Remove button and the mystery spacing on one of the div elements.

### R1D10
Day10 - Worked on setting up a layout for a Color Scheme generator using The Color API & began adding in some JS.
